            <p>Donating the cause is very easy and convenient. A unit contribution of Rs 1000 will help us in

                meals. You can choose in multiple units of 1,2,3 or more. With the funds collected, iCharity, as a reach

            <p>You might think about charity as something you do with the extra change you find lying around, or by
                supporting a friend
                running in a local race. That's how we used to feel — until we learned how much even a modest amount of
                charity can
                accomplish when given to the right organizations. It's common for charities to make big promises, and in
                most cases they
                can't deliver. But after researching hundreds of charities and the programs they carry out, we've found
                a
                few that can
                truly demonstrate impact. With these charities, your donation can make a real difference.</p>

            <h1>They need us to survive</h1>
            <p>Each year, when the country faces floods, these issues resurface even though floods are not unusual in
                Bangladesh. About
                17 percent of Bangladesh remains underwater throughout the year, which is needed for environmental
                balance. Regular
                floods inundate around 18 percent of Bangladesh. So, approximately 35 percent of the country is under
                water during
                regular floods. Therefore, Bangladesh will have to learn to live with this situation. Indeed,
                Bangladeshi people have
                been coping with this annual deluge historically. What is needed most is to learn how to manage floods
                better with
                minimum damage of lives and livelihoods, and how to reduce flood-induced vulnerability. Adapting to
                floods is the key
                strategy for Bangladesh and a crucial part of its policy on disaster risk reduction</p>
